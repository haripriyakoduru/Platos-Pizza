### Project Description:
- Explore and analyze pizza sales data to make data-driven recommendations for improving sales and operational efficiency.
- Address questions about pizza sales, customer preferences, and business trends.

### Data Sources:
- The dataset was obtained from Maven Analytics and is publicly accessible.
- Minimal preprocessing was performed, focusing on date and time column adjustments for compatibility. The data was already clean and ready for analysis.
- All dataset files are included within the project repository.

It contains 4 sheets/tables:
1. ORDERS
2. ORDER_DETAILS
3. PIZZAS
4. PIZZA_TYPES

### Tools Used:
**Python** for data analysis and applied essential concepts like data transformation and visualization.

Utilzed Python libraries such as:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Plotly

### Skills/Concepts Demonstrated:
1. Data Manipulation
2. Data Visualization
3. Data Cleaning
4. Statistical Analysis
5. Problem Solving
6. Communication

### Conclusion and Recommendations:
Recommendations to improve sales and work efficiency:

**Sales**:

1. **Prioritize Top Performers**: First, focus on promoting pizzas that excel in both revenue and units sold.

2. **Revenue Focus**: Secondly, give priority to pizzas with the highest revenue figures.

3. **Classic Category**: The Classic category consistently stands out in both revenue and units sold. It should be your primary focus. Consider promoting the Supreme category next.

4. **Price Adjustment**: To diversify sales, consider adjusting pricing strategies to attract more customers to categories other than Classic, as customers tend to favor it due to its affordability.

**Work Efficiency**:

1. **Optimize Table Arrangement**: With 67% of customers ordering at least 2 pizzas, consider rearranging seating to accommodate more two-seat tables and expanding the total table count.

2. **Popular Sizes**: Smaller (S-L) pizza sizes are more popular, likely due to their lower prices.

3. **Peak Times**: Fridays, evenings, and afternoons are the busiest times, with 12-1 pm being the peak hour. Be prepared for high demand during these hours.

4. **Top Months**: High foot traffic is observed in July, May, November, March, and January. Plan accordingly for these peak months.
